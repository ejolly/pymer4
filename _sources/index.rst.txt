:code:`pymer4` is a statistics library for estimating various regression and multi-level models in Python. Love `lme4  <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html>`_ in R, but prefer to work in the scientific Python ecosystem? This package has got you covered!

:code:`pymer4` provides a clean interface that hides the back-and-forth code required when moving between R and Python. In other words, you can work completely in Python, never having to deal with R, but get (most) of lme4's goodness. This is accomplished using `rpy2 <https://rpy2.github.io/doc/latest/html/index.html/>`_ to interface between langauges.

Additionally :code:`pymer4` can fit various additional regression models with some bells, such as robust standard errors, and two-stage regression (summary statistics) models. See the features page for more information.  

**TL;DR** This package is your new *simple* Pythonic drop-in replacement for :code:`lm()` or :code:`glmer()` in R.

For an example of what's possible check out the tutorials or `this blog post <https://eshinjolly.com/2019/02/18/rep_measures/>`_ comparing different modeling strategies for clustered/repeated-measures data.
