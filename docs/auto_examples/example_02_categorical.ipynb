        "Lmer Models\n-----------\n:code:`Lmer()` models currently have support for handling categorical predictors in one of three ways based on how R's :code:`factor()` works (see the note at the end of this tutorial):\n\n- Dummy-coded factor levels (treatment contrasts) in which each model term is the difference between a factor level and a selected reference level\n- Orthogonal polynomial contrasts in which each model term is a polynomial contrast across factor levels (e.g. linear, quadratic, cubic, etc)\n- Custom contrasts for each level of a factor, which should be provided in the manner expected by R.\n\nTo make re-parameterizing models easier, factor codings are passed as a dictionary to the :code:`factors` argument of a model's :code:`.fit()`. This obviates the need for adjusting data-frame properties as in R. Note that this is **different** from :code:`Lm` and :code:`Lm2` models above which expect factor codings in their formulae (because patsy does).\n\nEach of these ways also enables you to easily compute post-hoc comparisons between factor levels, as well as interactions between continuous predictors and each factor level.

        "User-created contrasts (without R)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnother option available to you is fitting a model with *only* your desired contrast(s) rather than a full set of k-1 contrasts. Contrary to how statistics is usually taught, you don't ever *have to* include a full set of k-1 contrasts for a k level factor! The upside to doing this is that you won't need to rely on R to compute anything for you (aside from the model fit), and you will have a model with exactly the number of terms as contrasts you desire, giving you complete control. The downside is that post-hoc tests will no longer be available (see tutorial 3 for more information on post-hoc tests), but it's unlikely you're doing post-hoc tests if you are computing a subset of specific contrasts anyway. This is also a useful approach if you don't want to use patsy's formula syntax with :code:`Lm` and :code:`Lm2` as noted above.\n\nThis can be accomplished by creating new columns in your dataframe to test specific hypotheses and is trivial to do with pandas `map <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25/reference/api/pandas.Series.map.html/>`_ and `assign <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html/>`_ methods.

This because the :code:`contrasts()` command in R doesn't actually expect contrast weights (i.e. a design matrix) as one would intuit. Rather, it is made for generating contrast coding schemes which are the inverse of the contrast weight matrix. For a longer explanation with examples see `this reference <https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/65059_586f394d8eb84f84b1baaf56ffb6b47f.html>`_ and `this reference <https://github.com/ejolly/R/blob/master/Guides/Contrasts_in_R.md>`_. For these situations pymer4 offers a few utility functions to convert between these matrix types if desired in :code:`pymer4.utils`: :code:`R2con()` and :code:`con2R()`.\n\n"
