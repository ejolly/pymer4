This is the R model object readable in R using :code:`readRDS`.\n\nPrior to version 0.8.1 models were saved to HDF5 files using [deepdish](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/deepdish/) but this library is no longer maintained. If you have old models saved as :code:`.h5` or :code:`.hdf5` files you should use the same version of pymer4 that you used to estimate those models.\n\nTo persist models you can use the dedicated :code:`save_model` and :code:`load_model` functions from the :code:`pymer4.io` module\n\n"
